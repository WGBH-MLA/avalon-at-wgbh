Mystery of the Senses,,Default Unit,,Mystery of the Senses - part 5 Vision,2020-02-11,,,,,,1994-12-20,,"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This series, based on the book ""A Natural History of the Senses"" by Diane Ackerman, celebrates and explores the five senses: hearing, smell, taste, touch and vision. 
Hearing: takes viewers to the Greenland ice cap, the most silent place on earth, and to the loudest chanters among the New Zealand Maori. It reveals the tricks of the sound trade that pleasurably fool people in movies like ""Jurassic Park"" and captures the science and wonder as a blind and deaf woman comes to hear for the first time. 
Smell: This episode probes the mysteries of sexual attraction, from the perverse excitement of body odor to the magnetism of bottled fragrance, beginning with ancient frankincense in Arab Oman and culminating in the modern secrets of the Manhattan launch of a new perfume. 
Taste: The delights of taste are discovered in the secrets of a master French chef, at a festive dinner at home and in a graveyard meal shared with long-dead ancestors in Mexico. 
Touch: The most suppressed sense, touch is bound by strict cultural rules. The program uncovers what these restrictions might deny humans in comfort, assurance and arousal. Other subjects examined are the fingertips of a cliff climber, the kneading hands of a potter and the subtle communications of love expressed and love repressed. 
Vision: shows how the brain sorts out images the eye captures and how visual memory and imagination almost instantly recolor reality. Through the diversity of painting, the meaning of individual ""inner vision"" is explored.


ITEM DESCRIPTION: Episode of Nova focused on vision, how human beings take in visual information and process it, and the various quirks of our vision.

Premiered locally with three pilot programs in July and August 1962, nationally in Feb. 1963 - approx. 300 shows produced.  1963-1973.

Original series ran 1963 to July 1966, then went into reruns through September 1970.

In October 1970 the new French Chef 200 series was shot in color and taped on the set at WGBH. Included in the programs were footage of Julia�s summer trip to France.

The 1971-1972 season was a tour of the French Classics: 26 half hour programs designed as a refresher course for experienced cooks and as a jet-assist takeoff for beginners.

After a funding scare, Polaroid funded a full 1972-1973 season.  The theme was: The French Chef Faces Life.  Julia shows viewers how to cope with situations that reflect the demands of society, family and lifestyle such as Sudden Company or a three course sit down dinner and getting kids involved in cooking.

NOTE: Beginning August 6, 1972,  The French Chef repeated popular shows as a captioned edition.

American Experience,,Default Unit,,FDR (Part 2),2020-01-29,,,,,,,,"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This miniseries offers an in-depth portrait of a man who changed America's ideas about the presidency--Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  The series includes archival film, home movies and audio clips.  Included are interviews with Curtis Roosevelt, FDR's grandson; Eleanor Roosevelt, his niece; Eleanor Seagraves, his granddaughter; FDR biographers Geoffrey Ward, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Hugh Gallagher; journalist Alistair Cooke; and White House butler Alonzo Fields.  Author and historian David McCullough narrates.
Episode descriptions are as follows:   #701- ""The Center of the World"" - explores Roosevelt's family background and education, follows his early political career, and his courtship of his distant cousin Eleanor Roosevelt and their troubled marriage (including FDR's affair with Lucy Mercer, Eleanor's social secretary.)  ""Fear Itself"" - begins with Roosevelt's bout with polio at age 39 and follows his struggle to rehabilitate his body and his political career.  It also looks at Eleanor's involvement in politics.  #702 - ""The Grandest Job in the World"" focuses on the first two terms of Roosevelt's presidency and explores the paradox that a man of privilege came to be a hero to a varied coalition of ordinary Americans and a villain to members of his own social class.  The segment looks at FDR's struggle with the Depression, how he hid his physical disability from the American people, and how his relationship with his wife affected his personal and professional lives.  ""The Juggler"" - traces FDR's management of the war, including his growing personal ties to Winston Churchill and his relationship with Josef Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The program also explores Eleanor's attempt to convince him to maintain the principles of the New Deal despite the pressures of war.
