Mystery of the Senses,,Default Unit,,Mystery of the Senses - part 5 Vision,2020-02-11,,,,,,1994-12-20,,"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This series, based on the book ""A Natural History of the Senses"" by Diane Ackerman, celebrates and explores the five senses: hearing, smell, taste, touch and vision. 
Hearing: takes viewers to the Greenland ice cap, the most silent place on earth, and to the loudest chanters among the New Zealand Maori. It reveals the tricks of the sound trade that pleasurably fool people in movies like ""Jurassic Park"" and captures the science and wonder as a blind and deaf woman comes to hear for the first time. 
Smell: This episode probes the mysteries of sexual attraction, from the perverse excitement of body odor to the magnetism of bottled fragrance, beginning with ancient frankincense in Arab Oman and culminating in the modern secrets of the Manhattan launch of a new perfume. 
Taste: The delights of taste are discovered in the secrets of a master French chef, at a festive dinner at home and in a graveyard meal shared with long-dead ancestors in Mexico. 
Touch: The most suppressed sense, touch is bound by strict cultural rules. The program uncovers what these restrictions might deny humans in comfort, assurance and arousal. Other subjects examined are the fingertips of a cliff climber, the kneading hands of a potter and the subtle communications of love expressed and love repressed. 
Vision: shows how the brain sorts out images the eye captures and how visual memory and imagination almost instantly recolor reality. Through the diversity of painting, the meaning of individual ""inner vision"" is explored.


ITEM DESCRIPTION: Episode of Nova focused on vision, how human beings take in visual information and process it, and the various quirks of our vision.

Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back,,Default Unit,,Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back,2020-02-11,,,,,,1994-05-05,,"PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program follows the gripping story of Apollo 13's sudden, devastating emergency - which happened when an oxygen tank ruptured en route to the moon on April 13, 1970, cutting off most of the crew's consumables of air, electricity and water - and the desperate efforts to get the astronauts home alive.  The film tells the inside stories of the major participants in this real-life drama:  the astronauts in space, James Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert (who is deceased); flight directors Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz; mission operations chief Christopher Kraft; and, the controllers on the ground who dealt with a bewildering series of emergencies across 200,000 miles.  This program marks the 25th anniversary of the historic moon landing in July, 1969.  Narrated by Will Lyman.

The documentary follows the group's return to Ethiopia and includes discussions and explanations of their current and previous visit.",Audio Master (full mix),"2/10/2020 JC: Dolby tone at head of reel is the only alignment tone. The tone was transferred without decoding. After tone ends, the decoder was engaged for the rest of the reel except on track 24 (SMPTE timecode). Apparently, the final mix on tracks 5/6 was performed from the repro head on the original machine, and are delayed from the source tracks, with the exception of track 13 (narration) which was mixed from the SelRep head (as per notes on the reel box). The final mix (tracks 5/6) requires an offset in order to be synched to the correct timecode. The box appears to say an offset of ""5.60"" is required.  Track 19 has no content beside the Dolby tone at head.  , End Cut Off",Documentary,,Sound,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Travel,Peoples of East Africa,Sports,,,,,,,,,,,,,video recording identifier,285460,,,barcode285460_01.wav,http://hls-streaming.mla-int.wgbh.org/avalon/23065/barcode285460/PreservationMaster/barcode285460_01.mp4/master.m3u8,,,,,,,,,480,360,,,,,4:03,480x360,,,,,,
