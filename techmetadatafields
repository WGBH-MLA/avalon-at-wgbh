Further Things To Change
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-after_save MasterFile -> update_stills_from_offset! (if value changed)
  runs ExtractStillJob -> runs MasterFile#extract_frame -> runs Masterfile#get_ffmpeg_frame_data
    this runs master_file_behavior#stream_details -> should pick up hls stream if derivative object is there with correct streaming url
      how you get that darn streaming URL into the derivative? might need a script for this, because its not submittable through the manifest csv

  may have to just dump this, if it seems to be dependent on files

-do it delete the techdata csv as well when complete?!
